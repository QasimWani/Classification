# Classification Models built from Scratch
All things classification. 
### In this repo, I'll be implementing several ML classification algorithms from scratch.
## <center>Here are a few with their Examples</center>
##### KNN - Predict whether a patient has diabetes or not.
##### SVM (linear kernel) - Predict whether a patient has benign or malignant breast cancer
##### Naive Bayes Classifier - Predict whether an incoming SMS/Email is Spam or Ham (non-spam)
##### Multinomial Naive Bayes TD-IDF Classifier - Predict whether a tweet promotes Xenophobia or not

Some more to come:
> Logistic Regression Classifier


> Descision Trees
> > Random Forest and Bagging
